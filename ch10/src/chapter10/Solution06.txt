Imagine you have a 20 GB file with one string per line. Explain bow you would sort
the file.

Since the file is so huge, we will be unable to bring the entire data into memory.
As a result, none of the in-place sorting algorithms will work. The solution is to
bring only parts, or chunks, of the file into the memory at a time. Each chunk should
be sorted and saved to the memory. Then, we bring the sorted chunks back into the memory
and sort them one-by-one.
